# jsdoc2md-jsonDoc--partial-helpers
This is (partially temporal) repository holding my helpers and partial for **docs** generating tools like `jsonDoc` and `jsdoc2md`.

## jsdoc2md
For this library ([jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown: Generate markdown documentation from jsdoc-annotated javascript](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown)) my configs here should by temporaly. In long term, it will be much better to switch [jsdoc2md/dmd-plugin-example: A example dmd plug-in and boilerplate](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/dmd-plugin-example) (besed on [Create a plugin Â· jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown Wiki](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown/wiki/Create-a-plugin#create-a-plugin)).
